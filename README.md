# PlayerScaling
This mod changes the scaling of difficulty and various factors to create better gameplay for larger groups. Scaling begins after 4 players and in general you can expect a multiple every additional 4, so 1x scaling at 4 players, 2x at 8 players, 3x at 12, etc.

## Map Size
The map size scales linearly with players and will break past the normal limits. You will also see more than 4 extracts on these larger maps.

## Enemy Count and Valuables
Enemies and Valuables are multiplied in accordance with the map size changes, so you can expect to see a similar density of enemies and valuables as with a normal map, but there will be more overall.

## General Difficulty Scaling
The Game's general difficulty scaling will be accelerated for larger groups, but more subtly than other factors. Specifically the difficulty is multiplied by the square root of the player scaling factor.

## Other recommended mods
I highly recommend all of these mods for large groups for a better experience! <br>
[UpgradeEveryRound](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Redfops/UpgradeEveryRound/) is another mod by me that allows each player to get one free upgrade every time you visit the shop. <br>
[MorePlayers](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/zelofi/MorePlayers/) is a mod by Zelofi that allows you to break past the normal cap of 6 players. <br>
[MoreShopItems](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/GalaxyMods/MoreShopItems/) is a mod by GalaxyMods that increases the number of available items in the shop.
